Python code to merge pdf files

This is my first attempt to write Python Utility/Automation Script. We are using PyPDF2 Library classes to achieve this pdf merging functionality.

Logic is like

Step 1 - User provides path to pdf files that need to be merge.
Step 2 - Python code read input pdf file path and convert them into list of path.
Step 3 - Main PDF Merge function read each pdf file.
Step 4 - PDFMerger class object accept each pdf file.
Step 5 - Create a blank pdf file object.
Step 6 - Write merged pdf into blank file.
Step 7 - Finally close all PDF object created.
